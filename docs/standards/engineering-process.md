# Engineering Process

This document defines how `kaos-web` handles features, bugs,
enhancements, fixes, releases, branches, pull requests, and tags.

## Work Types

| Type | Meaning | Expected output |
|---|---|---|
| Feature | New user-visible capability | Design note if needed, implementation, tests, docs, changelog. |
| Enhancement | Improvement to existing behavior | Focused implementation, tests, docs when public behavior changes. |
| Bug fix | Correction of broken behavior | Regression test, fix, changelog if user-visible. |
| Security fix | Fix for vulnerability or unsafe behavior | Private handling when needed, regression test, advisory if applicable. |
| Maintenance | Tooling, dependencies, CI, docs, cleanup | Focused PR, verification evidence. |
| Release | Publish package artifacts | Clean tag, GitHub release, PyPI artifacts, changelog. |

## Issue Triage

Every issue should answer:

- What behavior is expected?
- What behavior happened?
- What `kaos-web` version, platform, Python version, and installation
  method are involved?
- Which extras are installed (`[browser]`, `[dns]`, `[mcp]`, `[nlp]`)?
- Is there a minimal reproducer (a small URL or HTML fixture is best)?
- Is this extraction, browser, crawl, domain-intelligence,
  middleware, CLI, MCP, packaging, or docs behavior?
- Is this unit, integration, network, live, benchmark, packaging, or
  docs behavior?
- Is there security sensitivity (URL allowlist, robots, TLS,
  credentials)?

Labels should distinguish type, priority, package area, and test tier.

## Feature Process

1. Write the user-facing goal.
2. Identify the public API surface affected (CLI, MCP tool surface,
   `KAOS_WEB_*` env vars, `KaosWebSettings`).
3. Decide whether a short design note is needed.
4. Implement behind stable boundaries.
5. Add tests at the correct tier.
6. Update README, docs, and examples.
7. Add a CHANGELOG entry.
8. Verify package build and install behavior when public API changes.

Do not use feature flags to hide unfinished public APIs. Optional
capabilities belong behind extras (`[browser]`, `[dns]`, `[mcp]`,
`[nlp]`); shipped flags must work.

## Bug Fix Process

1. Reproduce the bug.
2. Add a failing regression test.
3. Fix the smallest responsible code path.
4. Confirm the regression test fails before and passes after.
5. Check adjacent behavior for the same failure mode (e.g. a parser
   bug found in one HTML element type often affects siblings).
6. Add a CHANGELOG entry if released users are affected.

Do not mark a bug fixed because a broad refactor appears to cover it.
The regression test is the proof.

## Enhancement Process

Enhancements should preserve existing contracts unless the versioning
policy allows a breaking change.

Before implementation, decide:

- Is this observable behavior or internal cleanup?
- Does it affect performance, memory, errors, output ordering,
  serialization, CLI output, MCP tool output, schema output, or
  environment-variable behavior?
- Does it need migration guidance?
- Does it require benchmark evidence?

## Branches

- `main` is the protected release branch.
- Use short-lived topic branches.
- Branch names should describe intent:
  - `feat/<short-name>`
  - `fix/<short-name>`
  - `docs/<short-name>`
  - `ci/<short-name>`
  - `chore/<short-name>`
  - `security/<short-name>`
- Delete branches after merge.
- Do not reuse release tags as branch names.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the review unit.

A PR should include:

- Problem statement.
- Summary of the change.
- Tests and commands run.
- User-visible impact.
- Public API, CLI, MCP tool surface, schema, environment-variable, or
  package metadata impact.
- Release impact.
- Screenshots or sample output when CLI/docs/tool output changes.
- Risk notes for security, performance, dependencies, or compatibility.

Keep PRs focused. Split mixed work into separate PRs when review would
otherwise be ambiguous.

## Commits

- Use conventional commit style.
- Sign commits with `git commit -s`; this repository requires the
  Developer Certificate of Origin.
- Keep commits buildable when practical.
- Do not include secrets, local paths, generated caches, virtual
  environments, build artifacts, or browser screenshots from
  development.
- Use package scopes when they help release notes.

Examples:

```text
feat: add UDP probe for syslog
fix: preserve robots.txt cache across pages
docs: clarify --domain CLI flag
ci: add weekly dependency audit
chore: refresh ruff and ty pins
```

## Tags

- Release tags are immutable.
- Use `v<version>` tag format, for example `v0.1.0a2`.
- A tag represents the exact commit used to build and publish release
  artifacts.
- Do not move a public tag. If a published artifact is wrong, yank when
  appropriate and release a new version.

Branch, PR, and tag roles:

| Object | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Branch | Temporary workspace for a change. |
| Pull request | Review, discussion, checks, and merge decision. |
| Tag | Immutable release pointer. |

## Releases

A release requires:

- CHANGELOG entry.
- Version bump from `kaos_web/_version.py`.
- Clean formatting, linting, typing, tests, and security checks.
- Built pure-Python wheel and sdist.
- Strict metadata check.
- Fresh install smoke test.
- OIDC Trusted Publishing.
- GitHub release notes matching the tag and changelog.

Do not use static PyPI API tokens.

## Hotfixes

Use a hotfix only for urgent breakage or security issues.

Hotfix requirements:

- Narrow scope.
- Regression test.
- Fast maintainer review.
- Patch or prerelease version bump.
- Clear changelog entry.
- Follow-up issue if deeper cleanup remains.

## Security Handling

- Do not discuss suspected vulnerabilities in public issues until they
  are triaged.
- Use the repository's vulnerability reporting process in
  `SECURITY.md`.
- Rotate exposed credentials before cleanup.
- Add regression tests for security fixes where safe.
- Publish advisories when users need action.
